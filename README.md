### WELCOME TO THE DOC (Author: **a.emmanuel2@yahoo.com**)

This API gives you access to pretty much all the features you can use on mobile and web and lets you extend them for use in your application. It strives to be RESTful and is organized around the main resources you would be interacting with - with a few notable exceptions.

In this section, you'll find guides, resources and references.
